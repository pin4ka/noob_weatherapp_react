# ðŸŒ¦ Noob Weather â€“ A Practice Weather App

[Live Demo ðŸš€](https://noob-weatherapp-react.vercel.app/)

## Overview

Noob Weather is a practice project built to explore and learn modern web development using **React**, **Redux**, and API handling with the **OpenWeather API**. This project is designed to help you understand core concepts of React components, state management with Redux, asynchronous API requests, and using Yarn for dependency management. Although itâ€™s a simple application, it serves as a great learning tool and a base for further improvements.

## Features

- **City Weather Search:** Search for any city to fetch current weather data.
- **Real-Time Data:** Retrieve live weather updates including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean, minimalistic, and responsive user interface that works on desktops and mobile devices.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Displays error messages when an invalid city is entered or if data retrieval fails.

## Tech Stack

- **React:** Building the interactive user interface.
- **Redux:** Managing the global application state.
- **OpenWeather API:** Fetching real-time weather information.
- **Yarn:** Managing dependencies and project scripts.
- **Vercel:** Hosting the live demo of the project.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/noob-weather.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd noob-weather
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
4. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. **Search for a City:**
   - Type a city name into the search bar.
   - Press Enter or click the search button to submit.
2. **View Weather Data:**
   - The app will display current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather conditions.
3. **Error Notifications:**
   - If the city is not found or an error occurs, a user-friendly error message will be shown.

## Learning Objectives

This project was created as a learning exercise and to practice the following:

- Building and structuring React applications.
- Implementing state management with Redux.
- Handling asynchronous API calls and managing responses.
- Utilizing Yarn for project dependency management.
- Creating a responsive UI with basic error handling.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improve feedback for network issues or API rate limiting.
- **Unit Conversion:** Allow users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Refine the user interface with animations and a more polished design.
- **Additional Metrics:** Add more weather details such as sunrise/sunset times, atmospheric pressure, and air quality index.
- **Testing:** Integrate unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
